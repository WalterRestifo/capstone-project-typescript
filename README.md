## Hello guys! ðŸ‘‹

This is actually an app for mobile phones that tracks matches of a group of volleyball players.

You can create a new profile, upload a profile picture, submit a simple form, and you are in the pool of all the players. 

You can create a new match, add people to teams and track the points of the team.
You can filter the pool of players, so that you can easily choose your teammates by criterias like skill level, gender and languages.

The app will then automatically save your profile and the wins and losses of your team in a mongoDB databank in the cloud. The profile pictures are uploaded to a cloudinary databank.

This is only a part of a much bigger project, that I will work on in my freetime in the next years.
